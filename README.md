# CBOGlobalConvergenceAnalysis
Numerical illustration of a novel analysis framework for consensus-based optimization (CBO) and numerical experiments demonstrating the practicability of the method.

CBO is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method capable of globally minimizing nonconvex and nonsmooth functions in high dimensions. It is based on stochastic swarm intelligence, and inspired by consensus dynamics and opinion formation.

The underlying dynamics is flexible enough to incorporate different mechanisms widely used in evolutionary computation and machine learning, such as memory effects and gradient information.
